# StatisticalInference

##Objective : 

In this project we will investigate the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem. The exponential distribution can be simulated in R with rexp(n, lambda) where lambda is the rate parameter.
The mean of exponential distribution is 1/lambda and the standard deviation is also 1/lambda.
Set lambda = 0.2 for all of the simulations. 
We will investigate the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials and for that we will need to do a thousand simulatted averages of 40 exponentials. 

We will 

1. Show the sample mean and compare it to the theoretical mean of the distribution.
2. Show how variable the sample is (via variance) and compare it to the theoretical variance of the distribution.
3. Show that the distribution is approximately normal.
